Here is a sample content for an application for a sick leave:

Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to request a sick leave for [number of days] days, starting from [date] and returning to work on [date].

Unfortunately, I am currently unwell and am unable to come to work due to [briefly mention the reason for your illness, e.g. fever, flu, doctor's appointment, etc.]. I am under medical care and am following the advice of my doctor to take rest and recover.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better. If there are any urgent tasks that need my attention in the meantime, please let me know and I will do my best to complete them remotely.

I have attached a medical certificate from my doctor to support my application. Please let me know if you require any further information.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,

Shubha Raj Karki
